yii2-export
===========

A library to export server/db data in various formats (e.g. excel, html, pdf, csv etc.). The widget allows you to configure the `dataProvider`, `columns` just like one would do within a `yii\grid\GridView`. However, the widget is made lean to not render or process default grid table markup. Instead it will display a user friendly export actions ButtonDropdown menu or list. This can be embedded into any of your views that may or may not contain a GridView. It uses PHPExcel library for converting data to the right format for export.
