yii2-export
===========

A library to export server/db data in various formats (e.g. excel, html, pdf, csv etc.). The widget allows you to configure the dataProvider, columns just like a yii\grid\GridView. However, it just displays the export actions in form of a ButtonDropdown menu, for embedding into any of your GridView or other components.
